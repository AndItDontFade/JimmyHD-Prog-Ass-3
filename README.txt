Running program: Compile and Run HW3
Javac Hw3.java
Java Hw3

Note: This will run problem 2 ONLY. 
Could not get Problem1 to compile correctly, wrote the program and included the .java file here, but it is non-functional, has infinite loop.

HOW TO USE:
You will be prompted for the # of hours you want the program to run for
Type in the number of hours and it will proceed.

Hours are represented by 60 "minutes" which are represented by iterations in my program.
